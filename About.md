# Why Does Lyme need a Revaluation?

_This incorporates Rusty's, John's, & Rich's comments, but not Jan's edits_

Lyme's property tax burden has not been equitably shared for the last two years.  Higher value properties are taxed at far less than their true value. This transfers tax burden to lower value properties that are taxed much closer to their true value. This tax burden shift began with the 2021 revaluation and will continue until the next revaluation.

In 2021, the overall Town value increased 15%. But this was not the case for individual properties. Some property values increased by over 25% while others actually decreased in value. On average, properties valued under \$500,000 increased significantly while higher value properties saw moderate to no increase in value.

More recently - in the last 15 months - properties selling for more than \$500,000 have sold on average for 40% more than their town-appraised value while properties selling for less than \$500,000 on average sold for 15% more than their town appraised value, continuing the inequity of 2021. The following chart shows those recent sales.

## Why is this important?

If we do nothing, our tax bills will be based on the inequitable 2021 appraisal for three more years (until 2026). This will prolong the systematic unfairness within our town.

The shift of the tax burden to owners of lower-valued properties, arguably the residents least able to afford the increase, means that neighbors may be forced to sell and move away.

But even if a property owner could "afford to pay" the unfair tax bill, why should they?

## What can we do?

The remedy is to perform a "Full Statistical Revaluation" – to rebalance all the property values in Lyme, ensuring that homes in all price ranges carry their fair share of the property tax burden. That’s the reason we created the Warrant Article below for Town Meeting in March 2023.

## The Warrant Article

Article ###: To see if the Town shall require the Select Board to perform a “Full Statistical Revaluation” for the tax year 2024 to update appraised property values to more accurately reflect current market (ad Valorem) values and establish a new base year pursuant to RSA 75:1 Rev 601.02; and further to withdraw the sum of fifty-five thousand dollars (\$55,000.00) from the Property Reappraisal Capital Reserve Fund for this purpose.

## What will this cost?

A Full Statistical Revaluation would cost about \$55,000. The Town maintains a reserve fund for reappraisals that currently has \$56,000. The Town contributes about \$10,000 to that fund every year, so there is money to pay for the reappraisal. 

## Is this Warrant Article binding?

Yes. A petition article that has money attached is binding. The Select Board would be required to complete the Statistical Revaluation as called for by the article.

## Appraised Value, Market Price - What do these all mean?

The "appraised value" of a property is used for determining its tax bill. It is set by the Town's property value calculator, which attempts to predict the market price of the property. When a property sells, its sale price indicates the _actual_ market value. After a revaluation, the two values (recent sales price and appraised value) should be within 10% - between 90% and 110% - according to professional appraisal standards. 

A property that's "under-appraised" simply means that its (calculated) appraised value is below its selling price. In a rising market, new sales will frequently be under-appraised, mostly because the factors used to adjust the appraised value calculator fall behind the market. 

This is not a problem as long as the difference between sales price and appraised values is the same for all recently-sold properties. That situation is equitable since each home pays its fair share of the money required to run the town. 

But... it becomes unfair when sales price and appraised value differ across the range of prices. As we see in the chart, Lyme's lower-price properties are appraised closer to their sale price than more expensive properties. That is, those higher-price properties are getting a larger discount on their taxes.

Most importantly, this affects every property in town, even those that have not sold recently. Because the same factors are used to calculate the expeced "market price," expensive properties bear a smaller share of the tax burden.
