# About the Warrant Article

Warrant Article #16 at Town Meeting calls for a full Statistical Revaluation of the town. It asks:

<style>blockquote{  border-left: 3px solid #ccc; padding-left: 10px;}</style>

> Article 16: To see if the Town shall require the Select Board to perform a “Full Statistical Revaluation” for the tax year 2024 to update appraised property values to more accurately reflect current market (ad Valorem) values and establish a new base year pursuant to RSA 75:1 Rev 601.02; and further to withdraw the sum of fifty-five thousand dollars (\$55,000.00) from the Property Reappraisal Capital Reserve Fund for this purpose.

The article was added by petition to adjust property values to conform with market values, as required by NH state law, and to restore fair taxation within our Town.

## Why is this needed?

Lyme's property tax burden has not been equitably shared for the last two years.
High-value properties are taxed at much less than their true value.
This transfers a portion of the tax burden to lower-value properties.
This tax burden shift began with the 2021 revaluation and will
continue until the next revaluation.

In 2021, the overall Town value increased 15%, but the increase
was not the same across all properties.
Some values increased by over 25% while others actually decreased in value.

As a result of the 2021 revaluation, appraised values of properties
valued under \$500K increased by 17% while higher-valued properties only increased by 10%.
With those changes in appraised values, taxes on the lower-value properties increased 8.9%,
but the tax on higher-valued properties increased only 4.4%.

More recently &mdash; in the last 15 months &mdash; properties selling
for more than \$500,000 have sold on average for 65% more than
their town-appraised value while properties selling for less than \$500,000
on average sold for 18% more than their town-appraised value.

The following chart of those 44 recent sales shows how the inequity
continues from the 2021 revaluation into this year.

## Is this still important?

If we do nothing, our tax bills will be based on the
inequitable 2021 appraisal for three more years (until 2026).
This will prolong the systematic unfairness within our town.

The shift of the tax burden to owners of lower-valued properties,
arguably the residents least able to afford the increase,
means that neighbors may be forced to sell and move away.

But even if a property owner could "afford" to pay
the unfair tax bill, why should they?

## What can we do?

The remedy is to perform a "Full Statistical Revaluation" &mdash;
to rebalance all the property values in Lyme, ensuring that
homes in all price ranges carry their fair share of the property tax burden.
That’s the reason we created the Warrant Article below for Town Meeting in March 2023.

## What will this cost?

A Full Statistical Revaluation will cost about \$55,000.
However no new money will be necessary because
the Town maintains a reserve fund for reappraisals, which currently contains \$56,000.
The Town contributes about \$10,000 to that fund every year,
so there will be money to pay for the next required revaluation in five more years.

## Is this Warrant Article binding?

Yes. A petition article that has money attached is binding
when approved by the voters at Town Meeting.
