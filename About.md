### What can I do?

So... Your taxes went up a lot...
Or you can see the unfairness in the changes to people's taxes...
Here are things you can do:

-   If your taxes went up much more than the average (4%)
    and you cannot explain the difference,
    you can file for an abatement.
    Here's a link to the [Abatement Form.](https://www.lymenh.gov/sites/g/files/vyhlif4636/f/uploads/revisedabatementform.pdf)
    You **must** file by March 1, 2022 to receive an abatement (rebate) on the amount you paid in 2021.
-  [Here are some thoughts](./Lyme_Tax_Abatement-Feb2022.pdf) for filling out the abatement application.
These tips may help filling out **Sections D, E, and F.**
-   You may qualify for the Elderly Tax Exemption that decreases the assessment for your property.
    The property owner must be at least 65 years of age, have lived in Lyme for several years,
    and meet certain income requirements. For more information, see the
    [Elderly Tax Exemption page](https://www.lymenh.gov/assessing-department/pages/elderly-tax-exemption)
    on the Town website.
-   Talk to the Select Board - let them know that you have concerns about the process.
    Their email is [selectboard@lymenh.gov](mailto:selectboard@lymenh.gov)
-   Attend the next Select Board meeting on Thursday, February 10 at 9am to discuss this topic.
    You can attend in-person, or via Zoom (link coming...)
