### What can I do?

So... Your taxes went up a lot...
Or you can see the unfairness in the changes to people's taxes...
Here are things you can do:

-   If your taxes went up much more than the average (4%)
    and you cannot explain the difference,
    you can file for an abatement.
    Here's a link to the [Abatement Form.](https://www.lymenh.gov/sites/g/files/vyhlif4636/f/uploads/revisedabatementform.pdf)
    You **must** file by March 1, 2022 to receive an abatement (rebate) on the amount you paid in 2021.
-   Talk to the Select Board - let them know that you have concerns about the process.
    There is a meeting on Thursday 10 February to discuss this topic.
