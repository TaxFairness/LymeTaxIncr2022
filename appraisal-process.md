# Appraisal Process

_David Avery offered this terrific description of the Appraisal Process on the Lyme Listserv on March 6_

With all the recent discussion of Warrant Article #16 to be voted on at the town meeting, I thought I would try to offer a simplified summary of just how appraisal works in Lyme:

1. The Select Board (SB) is charged with overseeing the appraisal of real estate in town so that values can be used in calculating the property tax owed by each property owner. Recognizing that real estate values change due to various market conditions, New Hampshire requires revaluations be done at least every 5 years. Since SBs lack both the time and the expertise to personally conduct the appraisal, each year they issue a request for licensed appraisers to bid on conducting the work. In Lyme, twenty percent of existing properties are re-evaluated each year, plus any new construction.

2. The appraiser physically visits each property selected for appraisal. For new or renovated buildings, the appraiser will meet with the owner and inventory the property. This inventory will list the objective characteristics of the property such as number of acres, square feet occupied by each structure, the number of bathrooms, bedrooms and other such facts that affect the value. Subjective characteristics are also recorded such as the style of the structure (ranch, colonial, etc.), the quality of construction, general condition, location on a waterfront, or whether there is a scenic view.

3. Structures which have been previously appraised and for which there are no modifications (that is, no building permit being on file) are typically merely viewed from the street without entry.

4. These data collected by the appraiser are recorded on a form for each property in town. The attributes of the property are entered into the town database for real estate which is called [Vision](https://gis.vgsi.com/lymeNH/Search.aspx). You can get a printed copy of the attributes entered for your property from the town office.

5. The appraiser does not assign a monetary value for the worth of an existing property by inspection, rather the appraiser just inventories the characteristics of each property in town. Only in the 5th year revaluation is the property value finally determined by examining data on sales of property in town in a recent time frame. Only the values of "qualified" sales are considered. Qualified sales are those judged to have been an "arm's length" transaction (open market, not between relatives or abutters, etc.) This judgement is recorded in the town office as reported by the real estate broker or lawyer. Such arm's length transactions will also result in a transfer tax recorded with the deed in the [Grafton County records](https://ava.fidlar.com/NHGrafton/). Together the intent is to update the appraised value of the sold properties to closely mimic the actual "market value" based on the recent sales.

6. To determine the value of town properties which have not recently sold, the characteristics of each property in town are entered into software licensed by the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA). The characteristics of properties that sold and their sale price are used by the software to estimate the probable value of ALL the properties with similar characteristics in town including those which did not sell in the previous year.

7. The value returned by the software is the "appraised value". This value may then be modified in the town office by application of discounts as provided by law for such things as Current Use or conservation easements. This results in a number that is the final "assessed value".

8. The New Hampshire Department of Revenue (DRA) calculates the tax rate for Lyme utilizing the Town Total Assessed Valuation as reported to them on the MS-1 Report (Town Report, pages Town 125-130) and the various net budgets or tax efforts (Town Report, pages Town 131-134). Individual property tax bills are calculated by multiplying its assessed value times the tax rate (dividing by \$1,000). For example:

   (assessed value / 1,000) x tax rate = tax bill

   (\$450,000 / 1,000) x \$23.98 = $10,791

9. As a final step, any applicable discounts are then applied to the tax bill for approved exemptions such as those for qualifying elders, the blind, or disabled veterans.
