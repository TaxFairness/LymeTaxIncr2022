# Tips for Filing the Abatement Form

If you believe your property was incorectly assessed, consider filing for an abatement.
This is a formal request to the Select Board to review your property’s assessment.

_Rich Brown posted the following tips on the Lyme Listserv.
Feel free to use (or copy/paste) the information below into your Abatement application.
(Be sure to adjust Section E for your property.)_

**Application for Abatement**

**Sections A and B:** _Fill in your name and address_

**Section C:** _Fill in the property address to be abated_

**Section D - Other properties:** _Fill in the addresses of other properties you own (if any)._

**Section E: Reason for Abatement Application**

_List reasons that you believe your assessment was incorrect.
You can refer to the Town's "Old vs. New" document that shows the
2021 and 2022 assessed values for every property in town.

**Section F: Taxpayer's opinion of Market Value**

**Sections H and I:** _Signatures and certifications…_

## What happens then?

After you sign and file your abatement request (you MUST file by March 1, 2023), the Select Board will ask the assessor to review your abatement request. He will likely want to visit your property, inside and out. You can discuss the factors that affected his decision, and point out relevant factors.

The assessor will then make a recommendation to the Select Board for an updated assessment, which might result in a decreased tax bill (and a rebate).
