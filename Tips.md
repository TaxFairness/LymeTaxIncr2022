### Tips for Filing the Abatement Form

If your property tax increased more than 5% (the town average was 4%), consider filing for an abatement.
This is a formal request to the Select Board to have your property’s assessment reviewed.

_Rich Brown posted the following tips on the Lyme Listserv:_

**Application for Abatement**

**Sections A and B:** _Fill in your name and address_

**Section C:** _Fill in the property address to be abated_

**Section D - Other properties:** _Fill in the addresses of other properties you own (if any). You might include this statement:_

I do not agree with the statement that “[all properties] must be considered in determining … a disproportionate assessment.” If one property is incorrectly assessed, it should be corrected, regardless of whether any other properties are correct or not. If one property is 10% too high, and another 10% too low, it doesn’t “balance out”. That’s still unfair.

**Section E: Reason for Abatement Application**

In 2021, the Town of Lyme spent 4% more than in the previous year. If all property valuations increased the same amount relative to others, we all would expect our tax bills to increase by about 4% (in the absence of significant improvements or changes to the homes.)

The tax on my property increased by \$4,164, that's a 31% increase (\$13,381 in 2020 to $17,545 in 2021). This is about eight times the expected increase.

This increase is disproportionate to other properties in town, especially those properties whose taxes went down this year. As examples, see the data presented to the Select Board on 10 February 2022 for Breck Hill Road, 85 Dartmouth College Highway, and Wilmott Way (attached)

Finally, this disproportionate assessment, if left to stand, will continue for the next five years, increasing the unfairness relative to other properties in town.

**Section F: Taxpayer's opinion of Market Value**

As a non-professional, I do not know how to set a value on my property. Furthermore, my opinion is immaterial since the Town hired a professional assessor last year to set correct property values as part of the five-year Revaluation process. 

What factors did the Assessor use to set the value of my property? What comparable properties were considered? 

Finally, the question "Would you sell your property for this assessment?" is unfair and unreasonable. Not only is my property not currently for sale, but I have no recourse to this opinion. In an arms-length transaction, I can accept or reject the buyer's offer. I have no option with the town, except to file this abatement.

**Sections H and I:** _Signatures and certifications…_

#### What happens then?

After you sign and file your abatement request (you MUST file by March 1, 2022), the Select Board will ask the assessor to review your property. He will likely want to visit your property, inside and out. You can discuss the factors that affected his decision, and point out relevant factors.

The assessor will then make a recommendation to the Select Board of an updated assessment, which might result in a decreased tax bill (and a rebate).
