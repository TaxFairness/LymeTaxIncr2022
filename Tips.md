### Tips for Filing the Abatement Form

_Michael Whitman posted the following tips on the Lyme Listserv..._

If your property tax increased more than 5% (the town average was 4%), consider filing for an abatement, which is a formal request to the Select Board to have your property’s assessment reviewed. To do this:

1. Find the abatement form here: [https://www.lymenh.gov/sites/g/files/vyhlif4636/f/uploads/revisedabatementform.pdf](https://www.lymenh.gov/sites/g/files/vyhlif4636/f/uploads/revisedabatementform.pdf) and read the directions.

2. Section A: Name and address of property owner, and Section B: Someone representing the owner.

3. Section C: The “Town Parcel ID#” This doesn’t appear on your tax bill, but street address will suffice. For Description, show “Land and Buildings.”

4. Section D: List other properties you may own in Lyme.

5. Section E, Reasons: If you believe your tax increase seems disproportionate (too high in comparison to other properties), state your reasons, such as higher than the town’s 4% increase, or significant variance from other houses in your neighborhood, or other Lyme properties that you think are comparable. Visit the new Tax Fairness site at [https://taxfairness.github.io/Taxes2021/](https://taxfairness.github.io/Taxes2021/) to see other properties on your street.

6. Section F, Taxpayer’s Opinion of Market Value: A layman is hardly qualified to assess his property’s value, so this seems purely opinion, and of little or no value. Rather than give a specific answer, it might be useful to ask, “How did the assessor arrive at our market value?” and, “What ‘comps’ (values of comparable properties) did the assessor use to determine MY market value?”

#### What happens then?

After you sign and file your abatement request (you MUST file by March 1, 2022), the Select Board will ask the assessor to review your property. He will likely want to visit your property, inside and out. You can discuss the factors that affected his decision, and point out relevant factors.

The assessor will then make a recommendation to the Select Board of an updated assessment, which might result in a decreased tax bill (and a rebate).
