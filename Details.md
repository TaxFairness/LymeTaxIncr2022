### The Details - How was my property tax bill determined?

We are concerned about the fairness of Lyme's property tax revaluation in 2021:

-   Lyme is spending just about 4% more this year. You might expect your tax bill to have gone up by a like amount.
-   But... many properties went up by 20% or 30% - even when their neighbors taxes were unchanged
-   Properties valued between $100,000 and $250,000 (137) increased 12.78%
-   Properties valued between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000 (41) decreased 0.57%
