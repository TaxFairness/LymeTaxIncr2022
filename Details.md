# The Details - Why a Statistical Revaluation?

We are asking for a _Statistical Revaluation_ to correct some problems (errors) that occurred in the 2021 Full Revaluation. Here's a quick rundown:

Every five years, a town is required to do a Full Revaluation to calibrate
the parameters of the CAMA (Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal) model for properties in town.
The model has weighting factors that consider the number of
bedrooms, bathrooms, size of lot, neighborhood, construction quality
and a whole passel of other considerations.
From those, the model computes an Appraised Value &mdash;
a prediction of "market price"
if the property were placed on the open market.

Each _revaluation_ is an opportunity to
review all recent "qualified" sales and
adjust the weighting factors of the CAMA model.
When the factors have been corrected, the CAMA should produce an appraised value
that's within 10% +/- of the actual sales price for every one of the qualified sales.
At that point, the Town can use the CAMA model to produce new appraised values
for every home in town &mdash; as happened in 2021.

## What went wrong in 2021?

Here are some of the things we've observed:

- Small sample size.
  There were about 140 sales in the 2021 revaluation period.
  Over half were excluded.
  With such a small sample size, one outlier in the input data can produce incorrect results.

- Some exclusions are proper &mdash;
  a transfer from a couple to their estate doesn't provide any valid price information;
  a family sale or foreclosure (a four-bedroom house for $50,000) is not arms-length;
  sales that do not go through MLS (and thus aren't exposed to the market)
  can't tell anything about the "true market price".

- However, some excluded properties seem to be "qualified" &mdash;
  that is arms-length, market-rate sales, yet they were excluded from consideration, decreasing the "sample size".

- Furthermore, some properties that were included may not be arms-length.
  One property that was appraised about $1M in 2020 actually
  sold for more than twice that in 2021.
  It doesn't seem credible that this was an arms-length sale,
  and likely should have been excluded.

- We have requested the justification for including and excluding
  properties from the Town, but this information has not been forthcoming.

- Late delivery. In 2021 and 2022, the Assessor delivered the data after
  the deadline for the Town to file the requisite paperwork.
  The Select Board had to request a waiver to turn it in late,
  and consequently never really had a chance to review it.

- There are several measures (Coefficient of Dispersion
  and Price-Related Differential)
  that the Assessor and the NH DRA use to determine the quality/correctness of the appraisal statistics.
  Although the values computed for 2021 and 2022 are within the standards,
  the lack of supporting data for inclusions and exclusions casts doubt on their reliability.
  (The DRA has stated that they assume the underlying data is correct:
  they then check the Town's arithmetic. But that's not the problem.)

## How would a Statistical Revaluation help?

Bad data in gives bad data out.
The CAMA model was not well calibrated with its 2021 data.
Its predictions in 2022 continue to predict significantly low appraised values of more expensive homes.
This will continue until the CAMA model is recalibrated by a revaluation of some sort.

- Any revaluation would reset the weighting factors of the CAMA model for Lyme.

- A Statistical Revaluation assumes the underlying (physical)
  property data is correct.
  It reviews the recent sale prices and re-computes the CAMA model factors.
  (Because it does not require visits to properties,
  a Statistical Revaluation is less expensive than a Full Revaluation.)

- We are hopeful that the Assessor will deliver the data early enough
  (at least a month before the deadline) to allow the Select Board
  to review it and to pass it along to citizens for their review.

There is concern about the impact of Lyme’s revaluation on the fairness of Lyme's property tax for 2021:

- Lyme voters approved spending increases of about 4% more than last year.
- _But..._ many property tax bills went up by 20% or 30%
- Properties valued between $100,000 and $250,000 (137 homes and residences) increased an average of 12.78%
- Properties valued between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000 (41 homes and residences) decreased an average of 0.57%

#### How does Lyme determine a property tax bill??

The NH Department of Revenue divides the “tax effort” – the total raised for municipal, school (local and state), and county budgets - by the total of the assessed value of all properties. This determines the Tax Rate. The assessed value of each property (per thousand dollars) is then multiplied by the Tax Rate to determine each property’s tax bill.

In 2021, two things happened. The town valuation went up by about 15% (because of the revaluation) and the tax effort increased about 4%. If all property assessments increased by the same percentage, the average property tax bill would increase by about 4%.

#### What is the “Revaluation” process?

There are 1,059 properties in Lyme. 78 are tax-exempt because they are owned by federal, state, or local governments or non-profit organizations. The remaining 981 properties share the property tax burden according to their assessed value.

The State of NH requires the Select Board to maintain an accurate inventory of the property in town.
There are a lot of properties, so the Select Board contracts with
a professional assessor to perform this task on their behalf.

Each year, the assessor updates the records for one quarter of the properties in town including any new development. Every fifth year, the assessor reviews and updates the values assigned to all properties so their appraised value is at, or close to, “fair market value”. This updating is called the Revaluation. New values are based on standard assessing formulas, actual visits to the property, and any recent sales which indicate the _actual_ market value.

If all properties are appraised at the same relative value to market, the property tax burden will be shared equitably across all taxpayers.

However, if some properties are valued significantly below their market value while others are valued at or above their market value, the tax burden will not be shared equitably.

#### Why does this matter?

In 2021 there was a troubling variation in changes to individual property taxes. Many properties increased much more than the average - as much as 20% or 30% - with no clear explanation. This matters for several reasons.

- This matters to the individual property owner. When their taxes increase far more than the average, the Town owes them an explanation for that increase. If they file for an abatement, they may get the tax reduced.
- The increased appraisal carries over for the next five years, meaning the taxpayer will continue to pay on the higher assessment at least until the next revaluation.
- There is a pattern that modestly-priced homes received the largest increases, while higher-value homes saw smaller increases, or even decreases. This appears to be an unfair shift of the tax burden onto the lower price homes, arguably the least able to afford the increase.
- In this fifth-year revaluation process, the Assessor excluded a number of recent sales from consideration. This raises questions about the accuracy of the revaluation.
- Finally, if a significant number of properties are under-assessed (that is, if their assessed value falls below the fair market value), this has the effect of increasing the Tax Rate for all residents.

#### What can be done?

As noted, if you feel your tax increased unfairly,
you can [file for an abatement.](https://www.lymenh.gov/sites/g/files/vyhlif4636/f/uploads/revisedabatementform.pdf)
This is a formal request to the Select Board to review and possibly
reduce your assessment. The deadline for an abatement is March 1.

Also, the [Elderly Tax Exemption](https://www.lymenh.gov/assessing-department/pages/elderly-tax-exemption)
applies to property owners who are at least 65 years old and meet certain income requirements.

The Select Board plans to discuss this subject on Thursday February 10th at 9:00 am.
Questions about the variation in tax increases (and decreases) will be addressed since
they don't seem to follow any clear logic or pattern.
Please feel free to attend in-person or tune in via zoom (Link coming...)
