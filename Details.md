### The Details - How was my property tax bill determined?

We are concerned about the fairness of Lyme's property tax revaluation in 2021:

-   Lyme is spending just about 4% more this year. You might expect your tax bill to have gone up by a like amount.
-   But... many properties went up by 20% or 30% - even when their neighbors taxes were unchanged
-   Properties valued between $100,000 and $250,000 (137) increased 12.78%
-   Properties valued between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000 (41) decreased 0.57%

#### The Details

2021 was a fairly complicated year for Lyme property taxes. Typically, the tax rate is primarily driven by the voter approved budgets each year. Those budgets are offset by various revenues and then divided by the total valuation of all property in town to come up with a tax rate that is then applied to each individual property value to generate a tax bill. Historically, because Lyme does not see much new development, and valuations do not chase individual sales each year, the annual increase in town value hovers in the .75 -1.5% range. When budgets increase by 2-8% the result is a higher property tax rate each year.

In order to "catch up" with inflationary factors impacting property values, New Hampshire requires municipalities re-value property inventory at least every five years. The objective of this revaluation or "reassessment" is to adjust the values of property in town to reflect their "ad valorem" or market value in an effort to equitably (fairly) distribute the property tax burden. When the calculated tax rate is applied to each individual property, no property tax payer should be burdened with more than their fair share of taxes required to pay the town expenses.

While this seems rather simple, in reality it is rather complicated these days, for many reasons. Of the 1,059 properties in Lyme, 78 are not taxed because they are either owned by federal, state or local governments or non-profit organizations. The 3 utility properties are valued separately and not used to calculate the state portion of the school tax. The remaining 978 properties are far too many for the members of the select board to be able to value appropriately despite their state requirement to do so. So, the select board contracts with a professional assessor or company to perform this task on their behalf.

Typically, because it is not practical to review all 978 properties in a given year, the task is divided into quarters. The individual inventory of one quarter of the properties in town is to be reviewed each year, in addition to any new construction that year. The value placed on that updated inventory is based on the values established by the latest town-wide re-assessment. Then, in accordance with state law, in the fifth year, the values assigned to inventory is updated to reflect the most recent actual "arms-length" or market sales that occurred.

If the only factor impacting changes to the property value was inflation, then that increase in town-wide value would be shared proportionately across all properties. Assuming the amount to be raised in taxes remained the same while the town value increased, the calculated tax rate required would be lower. When that new lower rate is applied to the new higher individual property value, the resulting tax bill would not change. But it is not that simple. Budgets increase and all properties do not increase or decrease just because of inflation or deflation.

For 2021, Lyme's property tax effort increased from $9,429,071 to $9,801,021 or $371,950. A 3.94% increase. That was offset by the town-wide valuation increase from $354,174,300 to $407,568,300 or $53,394,000. A 15.08% increase primarily due to the town-wide revaluation of inventory. This resulted in a 9.71% decrease in the overall tax rate from $26.66 to $24.07 rather than an increase to raise that additional tax effort. So, if you did not experience a decrease in you property tax bill for 2021, it is because your assessment increase was greater than the town average of 15%.

While there was new development and home improvements that account for some of the town value increase, most of the change came from re-valuation exercise. Here, the variation in the amount of individual increases or decreases appears troubling. When some properties increase more than most, while others stay the same or actually decrease in value, a shift in the property tax burden occurs.

For this re-valuation, 423 property values were increased by more than the town average of 15% while 554 property values increased by less than the town average. In fact, 170 saw no increase or a decrease in property value. This resulted in a tax burden shift which unfortunately placed more of the tax burden on properties valued below $500,000 than properties valued over $500,000.

Properties valued between $100,000 and $250,000 (137) saw the greatest increase (12.78%) in their tax burden while properties
valued between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000 (41) saw a decrease (-.57%) in their tax burden followed by properties valued between $750,000 and 1,000,000 (65) with a slight increase (2.18%) and properties valued between $500,000 and $750,000 (189) with a minor increase (2.93%).

Unless corrections needed to be made to the prior inventory, the results of the 2021 town wide reassessments do not appear to fairly distribute the property tax burden.

Because the goal of the assessment process is to establish individual property values as close to market value as possible, the abatement process asks property owners to be prepared to defend their opinion of their assessment relative to the market value of their property.

This ignores the importance of valuing all other properties in town to the same relative value to market, in order to achieve a fair and equitable distribution of the property tax burden. If all properties are valued at the same percentage of market value, the tax burden is equitably shared. If some properties are valued at 85% of market value while others are valued at 98% of market value, the tax burden is not equitably shared.

An individual property may be assessed at market value but, if other properties in town are not, that property’s tax is too high relative to others. In that case, if all other properties where then assessed at market value, the total town valuation would be higher and the tax rate would be lower. Because there is no method to argue the assessed value of another owner’s property, this property owner should seek an abatement not of their assessed value but for the tax rate applied to that assessed value.
