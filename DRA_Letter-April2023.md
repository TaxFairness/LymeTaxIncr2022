# Letter to the DRA

A group of Lyme taxpayers has been following
property assessments in town.

Earlier this year, the Town of Lyme submitted their
list of qualified property transactions for the Ratio Study.
This is the official evaluation of whether the Town's
"appraisal estimator" software is accurately setting values
for propreties.
The Ratio Study computes a number of ratios
(notably, Coefficient of Dispersion - COD and
Price Related Differential - PRD)
that are the primary indicators of fairness.

We believe that the 2022 Ratio Study shows
that appraised values are **not fair.**

We sent a formal letter to the NH Department of Revenue Administration (DRA)
explaining our research and the questions we raise.
The most important paragraph is:

> We have extracted the data for transactions from the
> Grafton County Register of Deeds and compared
> the properties in the Ratio Study.
> Model 1 in Table 1 reproduces the DRA report which uses highly selected sales.
> We calculated the CODs and PRDs for a series of models
> of Ratio Studies that do not cherry-pick properties
> but include all armâ€™s length sales.
> These are labeled Model 2 through Model 6.
> **In no case, beyond Model 1, are the COD or PRD within the acceptable range.**
