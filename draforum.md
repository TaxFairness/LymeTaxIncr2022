## Report from the forum

_Michael Whitman posted the following to the Lyme Listserv on 4 February 2023._

NH’s Department of Revenue Administration sent two assessing experts here on Thursday the 26th to discuss Lyme’s 2021 revaluation of our properties, in response to the many questions and challenges by residents about the assessor’s work that led to inequitable treatments of apparently similar properties.

Curious? The town’s official, audio-only Zoom record of this 80-minute public forum is available at [https://tinyurl.com/2s4cy483](https://tinyurl.com/2s4cy483). The presentation is a little hard to follow because the speakers are not identified and they use a lot of jargon.

The DRA told the audience that questions about the assessor’s methods, data and conclusions should be directed to our Select Board, because under NH law they are charged with understanding and overseeing the work of the assessor they have hired to perform Lyme’s appraisals and assessments.

Because the assessor and the Select Board have only been willing to answer Lyme property owners’ questions about their own particular appraisals, a Warrant Article Petition is being submitted for Lyme’s March 14 Town Meeting for an official review of our revaluation’s data.

More info on this issue will be posted here on the LymeList, and open-ended discussions will be allowed at Little Town Meeting March 7, and our March 14 Town Meeting, or the public may offer comments, but not ask questions, at the Select Board’s meetings on Feb. 9 and 23.

Thanks for reading —
