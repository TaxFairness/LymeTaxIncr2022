# Whatâ€™s Up with Our Taxes?

Article #16, which calls for a Full Statistical Revaluation of the town, has been petitioned for the purpose of adjusting property values to conform with market values, as required by NH state law, and to restore fair taxation within our Town. Since the town-wide revaluation of 2021, the tax burden in Lyme has shifted disproportionally onto lower-value properties. Until a new revaluation occurs, this unfair burden will continue.

The graph below is a dramatic portrayal of how out of balance our current appraisals are. In the hot real-estate market of the past 18 months, most properties are selling for more than their appraised value. But more expensive places are selling for about 65% above their appraised value, while more modest homes are selling for 18% above their 2021 appraisal.

Since the appraised value is used as the base for the property tax, the impact of this imbalance has been to shift a greater portion of the tax burden onto lower-valued households.

Recent discussions on this Listserv regarding the School budget, the impact of property taxes on long-time residents and seniors, and the importance of diversity within our town, are all relevant to tax fairness.

When Warrant Article 16 passes at Town Meeting this year, many households should see their taxes decrease.
This article is intended to ensure that all properties in Lyme are appraised and taxed in an equitable manner.
