# Whatâ€™s Up with Our Taxes?

Warrant Article #16 at Town Meeting calls for a full Statistical Revaluation of the town. It was added by petition to adjust property values to conform with market values, as required by NH state law, and to restore fair taxation within our Town.

The graph below portrays how our current appraisals are out of balance. In the hot real-estate market of the past 18 months, most properties are selling for more than their appraised value. But more expensive places are selling for about 65% above their appraised value, while more modest homes are selling for 18% above their appraised value.

Since the appraised value is used as the base for the property tax, the impact of this imbalance has been to shift a greater portion of the tax burden onto lower-valued households.

Recent discussions on this Listserv regarding the School budget, the impact of property taxes on long-time residents and our senior citizens, and the importance of diversity within our town, are all relevant to tax fairness.

When Warrant Article 16 passes at Town Meeting this year, many households should see their taxes decrease.
More importantly, it will reset the factors used to set appraised values for the next five years so they are closer to the true market values.
This will ensure that all properties in Lyme are appraised and taxed in an equitable manner. Since 2022, our taxes have become demonstrably inequitable, and the tax burden has shifted disproportionately onto owners of lower-valued properties.
